5.2 Make a Century
Our second example is from Bird’s Pearls of F unctional Algorithm Design ([53], chapter
6). Knuth leaves an exercise in his The Art of Computer Programming ([56], V ol 4).
W rite down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 in a row, only allow to insert + and  symbol between these
numbers, parentheses are not allowed. How to make the final calculation result be 100?
F or instance:
12 + 34 + 56 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 100
It looks like a mathematics puzzle for primary school students. It is also a good
programming exercise if requests to find all the possible solutions. The straightforward
way is to brute-force exhaustive search with machine. F or every position between two
digits, there are 3 possible options: (1) insert nothing; (2) insert +; or (3) insert . Since
there are 8 spaces among 9 digits, there are 38= 6561 possible options in total. It’s a
piece of cake for modern computer to calculate these 6561 results, and figure out which
are 100.
