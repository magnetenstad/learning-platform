4.5.4 Polynomial functors
The arithmetic we introduced applies to objects in Cartesian closed categories. What if
we take functors into consideration? As functors apply to both objects and arrows, it
leads to the concept of polynomial functors. A polynomial functor is built from constant
functors (refer to The ‘black hole’ functor example ), product functors, and coproduct
functors recursively .
• The identity functor id, and constant functor KAare polynomial functors;144 CHAPTER 4. CA TEGOR Y
• if functor Fand G are polynomial functors, then their composition FG , sum F+G,
and product FG are also polynomial functors. Where the sum and product are
defined as below:
(F+G)h= Fh+Gh
(FG)h= FhGh
F or example, if functor Fis defined as below for objects and arrows:
{
Object: FX=A+XA
Arrows: Fh=idA+hidA
WhereA is some fixed object. Then functor F is a polynomial functor. It can be
represented as a polynomial:
F= KA+ (idKA)
