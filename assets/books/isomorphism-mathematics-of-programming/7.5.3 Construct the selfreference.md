7.5.3 Construct the self-reference
The last step in Gödel’s proof is to construct a self-reference. It’s such a TNT string,
calledG, which is about itself:
G is not a theorem of TNT.
Now we can detonate TNT. Whether Gis a theorem of TNT or not? If Gis a theorem,
then it states the truth that “ G is not a theorem” . Here we see the power of self-reference.
As a theorem, Gcan’t be falsehood. Because we assume that TNT will not treat falsehood
as theorem, we have to draw the conclusion that G is not a theorem. While known that
G is not a theorem, we should admit that G is truth. It reflects that TNT does not meet
our expectation – we found a string, it states the truth, but is not a theorem. F urther,
considering the fact that G has its number theory interpretation, which is a statement
of arithmetic property about natural numbers. F rom the reasoning outside TNT, we can
confirm this statement is true, and the string is not a theorem of TNT. However, when
we ask TNT whether this string is true, TNT could never say ‘Y es’ or ‘No’ .
G is that undecidable proposition. This is the sketch of the proof of Gödel’s first
incompleteness theorem.7.6. UNIVERSAL PROGRAM AND DIAGONAL ARGUMENT 243
