2.2 The Euclidean algorithm
As there can be mutliple common measures, we define the biggest one as the greatest
common measure. F ormally speaking, if segment V is the common measure of A and B,
and V is greater than any other common measures, we say V is the greatest common
measure of A and B. Given two segments, how to find the greatest common measure?
There is a famous acient recursive method, called the Euclidean algorithm can solve
this problem. It is named after the great ancient Greek methematician Euclid6. This
algorithm is defined as proposition 3, in book X7of Euclidâ€™s Elements[ 11].
