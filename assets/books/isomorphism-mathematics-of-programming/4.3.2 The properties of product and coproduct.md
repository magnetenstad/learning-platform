4.3.2 The properties of product and coproduct
According to the definition of product and coproduct, for any wedge consist of X and
arrows, the mediator arrow m is uniquely determined. In category SetSetSet , the mediator
arrow can be defined as the following:124 CHAPTER 4. CA TEGOR Y
product coproduct
m(x) = (a,b){
m(a,0) =p(a)
m(b,1) =q(b)
F or a generic category , how to define the mediator arrow? T o do that, we introduce
two dedicated symbols for arrow operation. Given any wedge:
A A
X X
B Bf
gf
g
Define
m=hf,gim= [f,g]
which satisfy:
{
fstm=f
sndm=g{
mleft =f
mright =g
Hence the following diagram commutes:
A A
XAB A+BX
B Bf
ghf,gifst
sndf
g[f,g]left
right
F rom this pair of diagrams, we can obtain some important properties for product and
coproduct directly . First is the cancel lation law :
{
fsthf,gi=f
sndhf,gi=g{
[f,g]left =f
[f,g]right =g
F or product, if arrow fequals tofst , and arrow gequals tosnd , then we obtain the
special case of identity arrow mentioned in previous section. Similarly for the coproduct,
if arrowfequals toleft , and arrow gequals toright , then the mediator arrow is also
the identity arrow. W e call this property the reflection law :
id=hfst,sndiid= [left,right ]
If there exists another wedge Y and arrows handk, together with f,g they satisfy
the following conditions:4.3. PRODUCTS AND COPRODUCTS 125
product coproduct{
hÏ•=f
kÏ•=g{
Ï•h=f
Ï•k=g
F or
hh,kiÏ• Ï•[h,k]
Substitutem, and apply cancellation law, then we obtain the fusion law :
product coproduct{
hÏ•=f
kÏ•=g)hh,kiÏ•=hf,gi{
Ï•h=f
Ï•k=g)Ï•[h,k] = [f,g]
It means:
hh,kiÏ•=hhÏ•,kÏ•iÏ•[h,k] = [Ï•h,Ï•k]
W eâ€™ll see later, these laws play important roles during algorithm reasoning, simplification, and optimization.
