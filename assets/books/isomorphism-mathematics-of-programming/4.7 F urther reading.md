4.7 F urther reading
W e can not introduce the category theory in depth just in one chapter. W e only scratch
the surface of the iceberg. The key idea is abstraction in category theory . The dual
concepts like initial and final objects, product and coproduct, can be further abstracted
to the higher level dual things, limits and colimits. W e did not introduce the adjunctions,
nor Y oneda lemma. W e did not explain about the increasingly popular monad concept in
programming. W e hope this chapter could help the reader to find the door to the category
world. Here are some good materials for further reading: Mac Lane, who developed category theory , wrote a classic textbook[ 51] targeted to working mathematicians. Itâ€™s a bit
hard for the new comers. An introduction to category theory by Simons[ 42] and Category
Theory - A Gentle Introduction by Smith are more suitable at the begining. F or readers
with programming background, Category Theory for Programmers by Milewski[ 45] is a
good book with many example programs in Haskell, and their corresponding implementations in C++. However, this book limits to the set category on total functions (the
Hask category to be accurate). Algebra of programming by Bird[ 6] introduced category
framework for programming in depth.
