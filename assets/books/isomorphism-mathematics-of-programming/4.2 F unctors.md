4.2 F unctors
W e mentioned category theory is the ‘second’ level abstraction on top of algebraic structure. W e’ve seen how to abstract all sets and maps, groups and morphisms, posets and
monotone functions into categories. The next question is how to bridge these categories
and compare them? F unctor13is used to compare categories and their inner relations
(objects and arrows).
