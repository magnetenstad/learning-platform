7.5 Proof sketch for the first incompleteness theorem
According to Hilbertâ€™s project, the first step is to formalize all the mathematics into a
system. Then study it with metamathematics. In order to do that, we need represent
every mathematical branch as a formal system, which only contains finite many axioms,
then prove it is complete and consistent. Among them, the most fundamental system is
the arithmetic of natural numbers. Many mathematical branches are isomorphic to it. In
previous chapter, we see how to extend natural numbers to define integers, rationals, and
real numbers. By establishing the correspondence between points and real numbers, we
can further treat the Euclidean geometry as arithmetic through coordinate geometry .
